15 participants (f=4, m=11, age=27.0+-2.1)) participated in data collection for target pointing in a spherical grid setup. 9 more participants (f=7, m=2, age=25.9+-2.9) were recruited for pointing in randomized spatial placement setup.

The subjects, upon hearing the instantiation beep, has to point at the target in a standing position and point at its center.
